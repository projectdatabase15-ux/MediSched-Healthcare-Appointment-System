## Project Description

The Healthcare Appointment System aims to simplify and streamline the process of booking 
and managing doctor appointments for a clinic or hospital. It provides a centralized 
platform where doctors, patients, and administrators can interact efficiently.

### Features

- **Patients:** Register, log in, search doctors, book/reschedule/cancel appointments, view prescriptions & upcoming visits.
- **Doctors:** Manage schedules, set availability slots, update prescriptions after consultations.
- **Administrators:** Manage users, generate appointment reports, resolve booking conflicts.

The system ensures that no two patients can book the same slot with the same doctor, 
improving clinic workflow and patient experience while helping doctors manage their time effectively.
